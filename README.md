# Machine Learning Algorithm
This is my first code in ML. I built a data set about height, sex, weight, age of some students. First, I use Linear Regression algorithm to predict sex base on height, weight and age. Another algorithm which have more exactly result I use is Logistic Regression.
Nearly, I have learnt much about probability, statistic. The third algorithm I learnt is Naive Bayes. The one model is Gaussian Naive Bayes, which usually uses for continous data, the other model is Naive Bayes for Multinomial Naive Bayes, usally uses for classify text like "Bag of words". I used two model to test on the same data then the result comes out is quiet similar.
